    <p>My dear Theo,</p>
    <p>Many thanks for your letter and the 50 Fr. note enclosed.</p>
    <p>I don't see the whole future black, but I do see it bristling with difficulties and sometimes I ask myself if they won't be too much for me. But this is mostly in moments of physical weakness, and last week I had such a fierce toothache that much against my will I had to waste time.</p>
    <p>However, I have just sent you a roll of small pen-and-ink drawings, a dozen I think. By which you will see that if I have stopped painting, I haven't stopped working. You will find among them a hasty sketch on yellow paper, a lawn in the square as you come into the town, with a building at the back, rather like this:</p>
    <p>Well, today I've taken the right wing of this complex, which contains 4 rooms, or rather two with two closets. It is painted yellow outside, whitewashed inside, in full sunlight. I have taken it for 15 Fr. a month.    </p>
    <p>Now my idea would be to furnish one room, the one on the first floor, so as to be able to sleep there. This [house] will remain the studio and the storehouse for the whole campaign, as long as it lasts in the South, and now I am free of all the innkeepers' tricks: they're ruinous and they make me wretched. Just now Bernard writes me that he also has a whole house, but he has his for nothing. What luck!</p>
    <p>I'll be sure to make you a better drawing of it than the first sketch. And after this I can venture to tell you that I mean to invite Bernard and others to send me pictures, to show them here if there is an opportunity, which there certainly will be in Marseilles. I hope I have landed on my feet this time, you know - yellow outside, white inside, with all the sun, so that I shall see my canvases in a bright interior - the floor is red brick; outside, the garden of the square, of which you will find <a href = "https://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/zoom.php?i=/vangogh/data/images/Vincent/Arles/F1487.jpg&j=%26quot%3BPublic+garden+with+benches%2C%26quot%3B+Vincent+van+Gogh+">two more drawings</a> more drawings. I think I can promise you that the drawings will get better and better.</p>
    <p>I have had a letter from Russell; he has bought a Guillaumin and two or three Bernards. And, what gives me enormous pleasure, he also writes suggesting in exchange of studies.</p>
    <p>I should be afraid of nothing if it wasn't for my cursed health. All the same, I am better than I was in Paris, and if my stomach has become terribly weak, it's a trouble I picked up there and most likely due to the bad wine, which I drank too much of. The wine is just as bad here, but I drink very little of it. And so it comes about that by eating hardly any solid food and hardly drinking I am pretty weak, but my blood is getting healthier instead of getting poisoned. Once again, it's patience I need to see me through, and perseverance.</p>
